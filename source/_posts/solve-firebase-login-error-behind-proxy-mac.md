**TL;DR:** Use [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/) if you're using HTTP/SOCKS proxy

Today when I tried to login to Firebase CLI I ran into an issue that stopped me from logging in. After approving the login request on Google's login page, the page kept loading something (a page served on `localhost`) and eventually it went to this page:

In CLI:

```
â–¶ firebase login --debug

I searched on Google, and I came across this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41040601/2465955). Looks like there's a known bug that Firebase CLI can't work properly behind a proxy. I quickly realized I have environment variable `ALL_PROXY`, `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` set because I'm using a proxy.

The ultimate solution is to use a system-wide proxy, which in this case [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/) is a very good choice, should you're using macOS. This kind of software makes **all** traffic go through a SOCKS5 proxy, so you won't have to manually set the env variable and therefore the problem gets solved.
