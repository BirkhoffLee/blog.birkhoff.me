As you would have been aware of that I live in China where internet is under strict censorship. I’ve been discovering ways to access the blocked internet resources.
<!-- more -->

So recently I switched to a x86 router which runs Proxmox VE. On PVE there’s OpenWrt and iKuai (I’m gonna replace this sneaky thing). I’m not covering these stuff in this blog post, instead I’m writing down how I deployed a ShadowSocks client implementation that routes traffic intelligently on my OpenWrt.

We are gonna use [Clash][1], you must have been aware of it because it’s in the title. [Clash][2] is a new software that is nearly the same to [Surge][3]. They both support “rules” mode which routes internet traffic depends on your rules. It’s so convenient that you don’t have to use GFWList anymore, and they are more precise and customizable, like you can route Google to a Hong Kong proxy, YouTube to United States and Netflix to Japan, etc. Clash also has a *redir* mode which can transparent proxy the traffic sent to `redir-port`, and this is what we are gonna make use of.

These are what we are going to do:

1. Download Clash to OpenWrt
2. Write some configurations
3. Configure OpenWrt
4. Route the traffic to Clash
5. Run Clash
6. Controll Clash
7. Profit!

# Download Clash
It’s quite simple.

```bash
$ mkdir /etc/clash
$ cd /etc/clash
$ wget https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases/download/v0.10.2/clash-linux.gz
$ gzip -d clash-linux.gz
$ chmod +x clash-linux
$ mv clash-linux clash
```

# Write Clash Configuration
It’s the most complicated step in this process. It depends on whether your ShadowSocks service provider provides a managed clash configuration. If they don’t, check these out:
* [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhie1/Rules/master/Clash/General\_dns.yml][4]
* [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhie1/Rules/master/Clash/Rule.yml][5]

You’ll still have to manually write the `Proxy` section. Ultimately, your Clash config **must** at least have these lines:

```yaml
port: 8888
socks-port: 8889
redir-port: 8887
allow-lan: true
mode: Rule
log-level: info
external-controller: 0.0.0.0:6170
dns:
  enable: true
  ipv6: false
  listen: 0.0.0.0:53
  enhanced-mode: redir-host
  nameserver:
    - 119.29.29.29
    - 223.5.5.5
  fallback:
    - 114.114.114.114
    - 8.8.8.8
Proxy:
...
```

Let’s tear it down. `8887` is the redir port,`external-controller` is for the API that we’re gonna use later to control Clash. We will use the `dns` provided by Clash to resolve all the domains. Notice that the port in `dns` is `53`, we’re going to talk about this in the next section.

# Configure OpenWrt
We’re going to change the port of OpenWrt DNS server to something else than 53, or it’ll conflict with Clash’s one.

Open up `[https://luci.openwrt/cgi-bin/luci/admin/network/dhcp]`, go to `Advanced Settings`, find `DNS server port` and change it to something else, like for example `5555`. Hit `Save & Apply` and done.

Clash is now taking over all DNS packets, so you get clean DNS results instead of polluted ones.

# Route the traffic to Clash
Open up [https://luci.openwrt/cgi-bin/luci/admin/network/firewall/custom][6], add the following two lines to the end of the rules. Be aware that you need to change `YOUR_SSH_PORT`. `8887` is the redir port we previously configured in Clash’s configuration.

```bash
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport YOUR_SSH_PORT -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8887
```

# Run Clash
Congratulations to your last step. Run the following to launch Clash.

```bash
$ cd /etc/clash
$ ./clash -d .
```

You can open your browser (make sure to disable proxies on your computer) and open `https://www.google.com` and see if it works! If it does, `Ctrl+C` to terminate Clash, and run the following to keep Clash running in background.

```bash
$ ./clash -d . &
```

# Control Clash
Remember the `external-controller`? We’re gonna make use of it… right now. 

There’s a fantastic web interface that does exactly the work: [http://clash.razord.top/][7]. Use your OpenWrt IP address, and the `external-controller` port to authenticate. Be aware that it’s in Chinese.

# Clash as a Service
We can make clash into a system service. Create `/etc/init.d/clash` with the following shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:                 Clash
# Required-Start:           $CLASH $pgrep
# Required-Stop:            $CLASH $pgrep
# Short-Description:        Start and stop Clash.
# Description:              Clash is a proxy utility.

GREEN='\033[1;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
BLUE='\033[1;34m'
NC='\033[0m' # no color

start() {
    echo "[+] Starting Clash..."
    # Verify if the service is running
    $PGREP $CLASH > /dev/null
    VERIFIER=$?
    if [ $ZERO -eq $VERIFIER ]
    then
        echo -e "[!] Clash is ${YELLOW}already${NC} running!"
    else
        $CLASH -d $APPDIR > /dev/null 2>&1 &
        sleep 3
        # Verify if the service is running
        $PGREP $CLASH  > /dev/null
        VERIFIER=$?
        if [ $ZERO -eq $VERIFIER ]
        then
            echo -e "[+] Clash has been ${GREEN}successfully${NC} started"
        else
            echo -e "[!] ${RED}Failed${NC} to start Clash"
        fi
    fi
    echo
}

stop() {
    echo "[+] Stopping Clash..."
    # Verify if the service is running
    $PGREP $CLASH > /dev/null
    VERIFIER=$?
    if [ $ZERO -eq $VERIFIER ]
    then
		kill -9 $($PGREP $CLASH)
		sleep 3
		# Verify if the service is running
		$PGREP $CLASH > /dev/null
		VERIFIER=$?
		if [ $ZERO -eq $VERIFIER ]
		then
			echo -e "[!] ${RED}Failed${NC} to stop Clash"
		else
			echo -e "[+] Clash has been ${GREEN}successfully${NC} stopped"
		fi
    else
        echo -e "[!] Clash is ${YELLOW}not${NC} running"
    fi
    echo
}

# Verify the status
status() {
    echo "[+] Checking status of Clash.."
    # Verify if the service is running
    $PGREP $CLASH > /dev/null
    VERIFIER=$?
    if [ $ZERO -eq $VERIFIER ]
    then
        echo -e "[+] Clash is ${GREEN}running${NC}"
    else
        echo -e "[+] Clash is ${RED}stopped${NC}"
    fi
    echo
}

# Main logic from script
case "$1" in
    start)
        start
        ;;
    stop)
        stop
        ;;
    status)
        status
        ;;
    restart|reload)
        stop
        start
        ;;
  *)
    echo "${RED}Invalid arguments${NC}"
    echo " Usages: $0 ${BLUE}{ start | stop | status | restart | reload }${NC}"
    exit 1
esac
exit 0
```

After saving the file, run `chmod +x /etc/init.d/clash` to make it executable. Now you can control Clash using:

```bash
$ service clash start
$ service clash stop
$ service clash restart
