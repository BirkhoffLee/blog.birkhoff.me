Today Apple pushed the new major update of macOS, Mojave. One of its most important new feature is Continuity Camera. In short terms, your Mac gets the photo file immediately from your iPhone/iPad when you take one.

Here's how it works:

* You right-click on a supported App, or simply your Mac desktop
* Choose *Import* from *iPhone* > *Take Photo*
* Your iPhone automatically opens Camera app
* You set the Flashlight, focus, brightness or something else, and you press the shoot button
* You click on *Use Photo* on your iPhone
* Your Mac *immediately* gets the photo file, to where your initial import request came from, for example, saving to your desktop.

I've always loved how Apple's products work simultaneously, like universal clipboard has been very useful too.
