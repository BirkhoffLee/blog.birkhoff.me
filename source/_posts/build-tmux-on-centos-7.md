So I have been recently annoyed with some super strange display issues that tmux 2.7 on my server produces. After some digging I decided to re-build version 2.8 (which is the latest release as of time of writing) of tmux.
<!-- more -->

We’ll be grabbing the official tmux repo from https://github.com/tmux/tmux, build version 2.8 and install it. Note that you’ll need root privileges to install tmux.

```bash
$ sudo yum remove tmux # remove old version of tmux
$ git clone https://github.com/tmux/tmux.git
$ cd tmux
$ git checkout 2.8
$ sh autogen.sh
$ sudo yum install libevent-devel ncurses-devel automake
$ ./configure && make
$ sudo make install
$ tmux # profit
```
