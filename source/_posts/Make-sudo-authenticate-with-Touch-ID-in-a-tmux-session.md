After the recent switch to https://github.com/samoshkin/tmux-config, I have been fully working under tmux sessions. Recently I found that the Touch ID authentication for sudo haven't been working. I searched over the Internet and found out `pam_tid.so` itself is kinda incompatible with *tmux*.

To solve this, I had to use a simple hack (someone made the solution for us, thanks!). I use [fabianishere/pam_reattach](https://github.com/fabianishere/pam_reattach), a PAM module for reattaching to the authenticating user's per-session bootstrap namespace on macOS, and it's updated just 18 days ago as the time of writing!

To install `pam_reattach`, you will need to run the following commands to download sources, build and finally, install.

```
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/fabianishere/pam_reattach
$ cd pam_reattach
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local $(pwd)
$ make
$ make install
```

Ultimately, make sure `/etc/pam.d/sudo` looks like this in the beginning of file:

```
auth     optional     pam_reattach.so
auth     sufficient   pam_tid.so
...
```

(Note that on major macOS updates you need to re-do the whole process once again.)
