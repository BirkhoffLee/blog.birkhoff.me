I recently read [this awesome blog post](https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved) and I'm desperate to share it to you :)

This blog post mainly introduces:

* bat: `cat` super-powered. Built-in syntax highlighting & scrolling.
* prettyping: Beautified `ping`. You can also alias this to the default `ping`.

```
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denilsonsa/prettyping/master/prettyping && chmod +x prettyping && sudo mv prettyping /usr/local/bin
```

* fzf: *A fuzzy search against the terminal history, with a fully interactive preview of the possible matches.*
* htop: `top` improved
* diff-so-fancy: `diff` enhanced
* fd: a modern replacement for `find`
* ncdu: DaisyDisk alternative in CLI. Calculates disk usage, interactively.
* tldr: Throw away man pages! tldr is the new hype.
* ack / ag: I don't personally use it, but I'm looking forward to using it in the future.
* jq: JSON parser in the CLI
